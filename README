NAME
    Acme::require::case - Make Perl's require case-sensitive

VERSION
    version 0.012

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::require::case;

      use MooX::Types::Mooselike::Base; # should be 'MooseLike'

      # dies with: MooX/Types/Mooselike/Base.pm has incorrect case...

DESCRIPTION
    This module overrides "CORE::GLOBAL::require" to make a case-sensitive
    check for its argument. This prevents "require foo" from loading
    "Foo.pm" on case-insensitive filesystems.

    It does not respect any prior "require" overrides, since it completely
    replaces "require" semantics. Therefore, it should be loaded as early as
    possible, perhaps on the command line:

        perl -MAcme::require::case myprogram.pl

    You certainly don't want to run this in production, but it might be good
    for your editor's compile command, or in "PERL5OPT" during testing.

    If you're really daring you can stick it in your shell:

        export PERL5OPT=-MAcme::require::case

    This module walks the filesystem checking case for every "require", so
    it is significantly slower than the built-in "require" function.

    Global "require" overrides are slightly buggy prior to Perl 5.12. If you
    really care about such things, load Lexical::SealRequireHints after you
    load this one.
